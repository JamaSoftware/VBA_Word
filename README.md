## Community Macro Downloads
In partnership with Jama's Consulting team, we'd like to offer some custom macros for our customers. These macros were written with VBA. Please note that these reports come as-is. Jama Support will not assist with the use or modification of the reports.
 
### Interested in having someone guide you through this process?
If you are interested in having a consultant tailor a report for you, build one from scratch or train you on how to write your own, please reach out to your Jama Account Manager to scope out a project.
